Description:
You have been tasked with creating a quiz application. 
Users should be able to answer questions and receive feedback on whether their answers are correct or incorrect. 
The application should function without any major bugs. You are free to choose the questions that will be included in the quiz.

Requirements:
Grade G
The quiz contains 10 questions. The questions consist of true/false statements with two possible answers: True or False.
In addition to answering questions, the user should be able to switch the page appearance between dark mode and light mode.
The user should be able to answer all the questions and then click a button to see their results.
Display the number of correct answers the user got. Use color and text to inform the user of their results according to the following criteria:
< 50% - Fail (red)
50%-75% - Good (yellow/orange)
75% - Great job (green)

Grade VG:
All requirements for Grade G are met.
The questions should consist of a mix of the following types (at least 2 of each type):
True/false statements - (Two answer options - True or False)
Multiple choice - (Four answer options, one correct answer)
Checkbox answers (4 checkboxes with answer options - 2 or 3 correct answers, the rest incorrect).
The user should be able to see exactly which questions they answered correctly and/or incorrectly when the results are displayed. (If the question was answered incorrectly, you decide whether to display the correct answer or not).
Technical requirement: The code follows the “DRY” principle (Don't repeat yourself), avoiding significant repetition in the logic.
